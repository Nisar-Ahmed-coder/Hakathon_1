# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Overview

Welcome to Module 2 of the AI/Spec-Driven Book, where we explore digital twins for humanoid robots using physics-accurate simulation and high-fidelity virtual environments. This module establishes how simulated worlds mirror physical reality to enable safe testing, training, and validation of robotic systems before deployment.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Explain the role of physics-based simulation in robotics using Gazebo
- Describe how gravity, collisions, and rigid-body dynamics are modeled in simulation
- Understand the purpose of high-fidelity rendering and interaction using Unity
- Conceptually simulate common robotic sensors, including LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMUs
- Distinguish between physical accuracy and visual realism in digital twins

## How Digital Twins Mirror Physical Reality

Digital twins create virtual representations that closely match physical systems, enabling:
- Safe testing of control algorithms before deployment
- Validation of robot behaviors in diverse scenarios
- Training of AI systems in controlled environments
- Regression testing for control algorithms

In this module, we'll explore how simulated worlds mirror physical reality through physics-accurate simulation (Gazebo) and high-fidelity visualization (Unity), creating safe, scalable, and testable robotic environments for humanoid systems.

## How Simulated Worlds Mirror Physical Reality

This module establishes how simulated worlds mirror physical reality to enable safe testing, training, and validation of robotic systems before deployment. We'll cover pre-deployment testing, safety validation, AI training and evaluation, and regression testing for control algorithms.
