# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Overview

Welcome to Module 1 of the AI/Spec-Driven Book, where we explore ROS 2 as the nervous system of robotic platforms, with a specific focus on humanoid robots. This module establishes foundational understanding of how computation, communication, and control signals flow through a robotic system using standardized middleware.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Explain the role of ROS 2 as a distributed middleware for robotic control
- Describe and reason about ROS 2 nodes, topics, and services
- Bridge high-level Python-based AI agents with low-level robot controllers using rclpy
- Understand and interpret humanoid robot models defined using URDF

## The Biological Nervous System Analogy

Throughout this module, we'll use the analogy of ROS 2 as a biological nervous system:
- **Nodes** act as neurons
- **Topics** act as synapses
- **Services** act as reflex arcs
- **Controllers** act as muscles and actuators

This analogy will be maintained consistently throughout the module to provide intuitive understanding of complex distributed computing concepts.
