# Claude Code Prompts for Module 2

## Digital Twin Simulation Prompts

These prompts are designed to help Claude Code generate content for Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) while following the specification requirements.

### Prompt Template 1: Digital Twin Concept Generation
```
Create educational content about digital twin concepts for humanoid robots. Follow these requirements:
- Provide a formal definition of a digital twin
- Explain the role in robotics lifecycle
- Describe the relationship to physical robots
- Maintain conceptual, simulator-agnostic approach
- Avoid implementation details
- Follow the specification in specs/002-digital-twin-simulation/spec.md
```

### Prompt Template 2: Physics Simulation Content
```
Generate content about physics simulation concepts focusing on:
- Gravity modeling
- Rigid-body dynamics
- Collisions and contact forces
- Humanoid stability concepts
- Keep concepts simulator-agnostic
- No plugin or code details
- Follow specification requirements
```

### Prompt Template 3: Sensor Simulation Content
```
Create educational content about sensor simulation covering:
- General sensor modeling principles
- LiDAR simulation concepts
- Depth camera simulation concepts
- IMU behavior, drift, and bias
