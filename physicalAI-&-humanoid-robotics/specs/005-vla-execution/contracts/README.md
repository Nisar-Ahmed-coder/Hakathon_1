# Contracts Directory

This directory is reserved for API contracts, interface definitions, and data schema specifications.

For Module 4 (Vision-Language-Action Execution Framework), this directory is included for consistency with the project structure template, though the module focuses on conceptual documentation rather than API development.

## Purpose
- Interface specifications between components (if applicable)
- Data schema definitions (if applicable)
- API contract documentation (if applicable)

## Note
Since Module 4 is conceptual documentation about Vision-Language-Action systems for cognitive robotics, there are no functional APIs to document in this module. The contracts directory is included to maintain consistency with the project's standard structure.

The VLA module focuses on:
- Conceptual explanations of Vision-Language-Action architectures
- Documentation of speech processing pipelines
- Cognitive planning with large language models
- Integration with ROS 2 action orchestration
- Capstone project for autonomous humanoid systems
