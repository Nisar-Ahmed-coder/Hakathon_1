# Contracts Directory

This directory is reserved for API contracts, interface definitions, and data schema specifications.

For Module 3 (The AI-Robot Brain), this directory is included for consistency with the project structure template, though the module focuses on conceptual documentation rather than API development.

## Purpose
- Interface specifications between components (if applicable)
- Data schema definitions (if applicable)
- API contract documentation (if applicable)

## Note
Since Module 3 is conceptual documentation about NVIDIA Isaac technologies for robotic AI development, there are no functional APIs to document in this module. The contracts directory is included to maintain consistency with the project's standard structure.
